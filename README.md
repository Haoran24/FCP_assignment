To run the simulation with default parameters, execute the script:
$ python3 assignment.py -network 10

To run the test functions to verify the correctness of the implementation:
$ python3 assignment.py -test_network

Output:
The program outputs the following plots:

Dot line diagram: shows the network image of the random network formed
